## Elveflow SDK

### Note on using the SDK

We aim to update this repository around the release of major updates of our SDK. Between minor releases simply updating the dll file to the latest version is usually enough to upgrade your code.

We always recommend [installing the ESI](https://www.elveflow.com/microfluidic-products/microfluidics-software/elveflow-software-sdk/) software at least once prior using the SDK. Older Elveflow instruments use an NI-845x driver that is installed with the ESI.  

> **Note:** For questions, requests or else do not hesitate to reach us on our [support platform](https://support.elveflow.com/support/tickets/new).
